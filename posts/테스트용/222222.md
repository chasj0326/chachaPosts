What is the difference?
If you choose to use the handler function, you need to mark the function with export default. While if you use GET as a function name, you should not use the default keyword.
When you violate this, Next.js will give you an error based on your wrong implementation.
When you export the handler without using the default keyword.
It will report an error during runtime.

TypeError: resolver is not a function
